# Diabetes_Dashboard_Insights_PowerBI
Power BI dashboard analyzing diabetes dataset to visualize key health metrics and trends for data-driven insights.

## Overview

This Power BI dashboard visualizes insights derived from the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**. The dataset contains various medical predictors and the target variable, **Outcome**, indicating whether a person has diabetes or not. The purpose of this dashboard is to explore key features influencing diabetes and provide a clear, interactive overview for further analysis.

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes data on female Pima Indian patients, at least 21 years old, with various health-related measurements. The dashboard primarily focuses on visualizing the relationships between these medical features and the diagnosis of diabetes.

### Dataset Columns:
1. **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies.
2. **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test.
3. **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4. **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
5. **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
6. **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m)^2).
7. **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function that represents the genetic risk of diabetes based on family history.
8. **Age**: The age of the patient.
9. **Outcome**: Target variable, where 1 represents diabetes-positive and 0 represents diabetes-negative.

## How to Add or Modify Data

1. To update or add new data, go to **Transform Data** in Power BI Desktop.
2. Upload or edit the dataset in the Power Query Editor.
3. Re-load the data to refresh the dashboard visuals.

## File Information

- **File Type**: Power BI (.pbix)
- **Source**: The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is publicly available on platforms such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

## Future Enhancements

- Adding advanced predictive modeling visualizations (e.g., logistic regression or decision trees) to predict diabetes occurrence based on key features.
- Introducing time-based trend analysis if extended data (e.g., follow-up records) becomes available.
